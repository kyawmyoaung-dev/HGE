                                    To pass the ultimate test of toughness, the Amazfit T-Rex 2 was sent into the extreme and unpredictable environment of space, where it survived air pressure 0.2% that of sea level on Earth, and temperatures as low as -64°C. During its two-and-a-half-hour round trip, the smartwatch reached a peak altitude of about 113,000 feet before returning to Earth at speeds over 180 miles per hour.

                                    Raptor is the world’s first cycling computer for people, not bikes. Raptor is designed to enhance every ride by projecting an unobtrusive AR layer of information out in front of the cyclist’s eyes. Having real-time information projected out in front of you allows you to keep your eyes on the road ahead – increasing safety while focusing on performance, body posture, and accomplishments or simply soaking in the views and enjoying an amazing bike ride.
